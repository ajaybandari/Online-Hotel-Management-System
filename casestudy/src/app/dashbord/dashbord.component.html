    <p>A hotel is an establishment that provides paid lodging
        on a short-term basis. Facilities provided inside a hotel 
        room may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small
        room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, 
        a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs,
        a flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, 
        lower-priced hotels may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. 
        Larger, higher-priced hotels may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool,
        business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment),
        childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium,
        restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Hotel rooms are usually 
        numbered (or named in some smaller hotels and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. 
        Some boutique, high-end hotels have custom decorated rooms. Some hotels offer meals as part of a
        room and board arrangement. In Japan, capsule hotels provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.

        Some hotels are built specifically as a destination in itself to create a captive trade,
        example at casinos, amusement parks and holiday resorts. Though hotels have always been 
        built in popular destinations, the defining characteristic of a resort hotel is that it
        exists purely to serve another attraction, the two having the same owners.
        On the Las Vegas Strip there is a tradition of one-upmanship with luxurious and extravagant 
        hotels in a concentrated area. This trend now has extended to other resorts worldwide, but the
         concentration in Las Vegas is still the world's highest: nineteen of the world's twenty-five largest 
         hotels by room count are on the Strip, with a total of over 67,000 rooms.

        Boutique hotels are smaller independent non-branded hotels that often contain mid-scale
         to upscale facilities of varying size in unique or intimate settings with full-service 
         accommodations. These hotels are generally 100 rooms or fewer
